# ANN-for-Building-Energy-Consumption-Database
 In this dataset, P0 to P6 are various architectural and mechanical parameters of a building which was simulated in EnergyPlus. ( I will update with more details as soon as the paper related to this research has been published) Furthermore, v1, v2 and v3 are output parameters of this simulation (namely: Energy consumption, Discomfort hours, and carbon footprint). The parametric Simulation for this project was done using Jeplus Software. and the initial models were created by DesignBuilder and EnergyPlus.
